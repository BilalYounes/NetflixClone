# Netflix Clone (Front-End Only)

This project is a front-end only clone of the popular streaming platform, Netflix, built using ReactJS and styled using SASS. The goal of this project was to create a functional and visually appealing replica of the Netflix interface, allowing users to browse and select movies and TV shows to watch.

## Features
- Clean and intuitive user interface, modeled after the real Netflix platform.
- The ability to browse and select movies and TV shows.
- Dynamic movie and TV show listings, complete with descriptions, ratings, and cover images

## Technologies Used
- ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- SASS: A CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of CSS and adds variables, functions, and other features to the styling process.

## Usage
To run this project locally, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the development server. The application should then be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Work
- Add a back-end to the application to store and retrieve user information, movie and TV show data, and viewing history.
- Integrate a real movie and TV show database to provide up-to-date information.
- Expand the recommendations feature to use more advanced algorithms and consider additional factors such as ratings and genres.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a demonstration of the author's ability to create visually appealing and functional user interfaces using ReactJS and SASS. The project can be used as a starting point for future projects that require a Netflix-like interface.
